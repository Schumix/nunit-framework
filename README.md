# NUnit 3.0 #

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Schumix/nunit-framework.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Schumix/nunit-framework)

NUnit is a unit-testing framework for all .Net languages. Initially ported from [JUnit](http://www.junit.org/), the current production release, version 2.6, is the seventh major release of this xUnit based unit testing tool for Microsoft .NET. It is written entirely in C# and has been completely redesigned to take advantage of many .NET language features, for example custom attributes and other reflection related capabilities. NUnit brings xUnit to all .NET languages.

This repository is for the upcoming 3.0 version of the framework. The [vision](https://github.com/nunit/dev/wiki/NUnit-Vision) is that the NUnit 3.0 Extended Testing Platform will be a world-class platform for individuals and teams using a test-centric approach to .NET software development.
